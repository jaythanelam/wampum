Its been a year since we started operating and it has been a wild ride.  Four countries, twelve conferences, three accelerators, a new HQ.  Now we have a new company name: Wampei Inc.  It is pronounced Whom-Pay.

We will be launching a new products and partnerships over the next two months, so stay tuned.  We have set some pretty audacious goals for ourselves, but that is what you need when you want to change an industry.
