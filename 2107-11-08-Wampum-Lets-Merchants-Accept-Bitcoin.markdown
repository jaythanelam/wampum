## Wampum Register© lets merchants accept Bitcoin with or without a bank.


Lisbon, PT (November 8, 2017) - Wampum, LLC (http://cryptowampum.com) announced the launch of its eCommerce disrupting software Wampum Register© which allows companies to accept Bitcoin payments directly.

Co-Founder Russell Castagnaro explains, “At Wampum, we believe that eCommerce technologies should be available to anyone doing legitimate business.  We help our customers leverage eCommerce technology with or without the use of a local bank.” 

Wampum is a participant in the [WebSummit ALPHA]: http://websummit.com/ program taking place in Lisbon, Portugal as well as the TiE Rockies Propel and Trout Tank pitch accelerators in Denver Colorado. Today, less than 10% of retail purchases internationally are paid for electronically.  Why? A third party like a bank has always been required to pay electronically. Wampum Register© allows our customers to accept payments directly, without the use of a third party. Taking direct payments costs far less than credit cards, has no issues with fraud and eliminates returned payment risks. Leveraging eCommerce technology makes an enormous difference to the business’s bottom line.


Wampum Register© solves real cash management problems by allowing merchants to:

1)    Accept cryptocurrency payments directly - with or without a bank
2)    Reduce the cash on hand for retail outlets that need to be secured and transported
3)    Provide pre-payment and online ordering options
4)    Access funds on the day of the transaction
5)    Pay employees, partners, vendors and other providers (who are not comfortable with large amounts of cash) electronically

Wampum Register© unravels the issues overlooked by existing solutions:

1)    No Bank Accounts required for merchants or customers.
2)    Customers can use any modern mobile cryptocurrency wallet app to pay, not just one app used for a few businesses.
3)    Customers can fund their wallets quickly and easily from other people, Bitcoin ATMs or any cryptocurrency exchange in the world.
4)    Because cryptocurrency is used instead of a proprietary transfer mechanism, merchants get their money the same day as payment.  That is better than a credit card or cashless ATMs, and far superior to the pre-paid value card networks.
5)    Payments can be accepted online via existing eCommerce platforms or in the store at the point of purchase.

Wampum Register© brings eCommerce into the modern era.
