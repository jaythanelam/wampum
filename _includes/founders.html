                <h2>Russell starts with <span class="italics">"Why?"</span></h2>
                <p>In my previous roles with other companies, I worked with <strong>Banks</strong> (e.g., Bank of America, Bank of Hawaii, First Hawaiian Bank, Central Pacific Bank) and <strong>Merchant Processors</strong> (e.g., WorldPay, Verisign, Paypal, First Data, Cybersource.)  <br/><br/>One thing I can tell you about all of them is that they do not make things easy.  Typically, to work with banks and processors,  merchants have to jump through many hoops, comply with anachronistic policies and adhere to ancient protocols that are meant to provide cover for lawsuits but not provide real security for systems. It is tough to work with these third parties, but if a business wants to accept electronic payments, there has not been an alternative. <span class="strong">Until now</span>.</p>
