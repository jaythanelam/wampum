Lisbon, PT (November 8, 2017) - [Wampum, LLC](http://cryptowampum.com) announced the launch of its eCommerce disrupting software Wampum Register© which allows companies to accept Bitcoin payments directly.

Co-Founder Russell Castagnaro explains, “At Wampum, we believe that eCommerce technologies should be available to anyone doing legitimate business.  We help our customers leverage eCommerce technology with or without the use of a local bank.” 

Wampum is a participant in the WebSummit ALPHA program taking place in Lisbon, Portugal as well as the TiE Rockies Propel and Trout Tank pitch accelerators in Denver Colorado.

Castagnaro continues, "Today, less than 10% of retail purchases internationally are paid for electronically.  Why? A third party like a bank has always been required to pay electronically. Wampum Register© allows our customers to accept payments directly, without the use of a third party. Taking direct payments costs far less than credit cards, has no issues with fraud and eliminates returned payment risks. Leveraging eCommerce technology makes an enormous difference to the business’s bottom line."

Wampum will help drive the newer, safer, fraudless eCommerce  of the future.
