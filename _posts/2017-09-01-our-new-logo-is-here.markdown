I realize that this probably isn't the most exciting thing you've ever heard, but we have a new logo.  When we started Wampum I hired three people on Fiverr and picked the best of the three of them. I only gave them two days.  

<img class="img-responsive" src="{{ "/assets/img/blog/OldWampumLogo.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="old logo">


It was about time.
