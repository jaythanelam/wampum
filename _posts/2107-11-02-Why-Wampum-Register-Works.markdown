## Reasons for using Wampum Register©

* It’s Transparent: Retailers can see all transactions, the flow of funds, transaction information, and total amounts.

* It’s Low Cost: Wampum charges as much as 90% less than other methods of payment since it leverages the Bitcoin network

+ It’s Legitimate: Bitcoin has a Market capitalization of over $80 Billion and processes more than 300,000 transactions per day.

* Banking not required: No need for either your stores or your customers to have or share banking information. 

* It’s Fraudless: All payments are pushed to your store wallet directly, so you do not have to collect any payment or personal information that could be stolen or misused.

* It’s Stable: The Bitcoin network has been running continuously with no downtime since 2010.  Your instance of Wampum Register© is dedicated to you and not shared across other merchants.

* It’s Safer (1): Removing cash from the system is safer for our communities.

* It’s Safer (2): Removing cash from the system is safer for your store(s).

* It’s Safer (3): Removing cash from the system means you do not pay armed guards to move cash around town.

* It Saves Money: Less cash means less cash handling by your staff and fewer cash pickups for your clients.

* It’s Better For Business: your stores will spend less time and money handling cash and more selling product to your customers.
