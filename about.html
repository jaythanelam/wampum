            <h4>More About Our Agency.</h4>
            <p>Wampum, LLC is a Hawaii company.  We believe that eCommerce technology should be available to everyone, not just those with banks.   Wampum leverages cryptocurrency technology to provide software that allows any legitimate business to accept direct electronic payments securely without a third-party like a credit card merchant or financial institution.  If a customer can and wishes to leverage a merchant or bank, Wampum integrates easily. </p>
            
            <p>Matt and Russell have decades of experience working in e-commerce.  We realized that if it was so hard for the large companies we worked with to keep away from all the obstacles put up by Credit Card Merchant, Banks and others, it had to be far worse for smaller companies.</p>

<p>We knew that the next thing for us was going to be fixing e-commerce.  </p>

<p>If you look at the Whole World of Retail Commerce Internationally, it comes to about $24T /yr. </p>

<p>Now compare that with the value of those retail transactions paid for electronically – it's $2T.  Let that sink in a bit.</p>

<p>In the past 45 years, the collective force of all eCommerce companies has captured less than 10% of the market. Is it because they are lazy?  No – I don’t think so…  Paying electronically must be done through a third party – a bank. And Banking doesn’t fit the realities of most retail today. That is the fact against which you can't successfully argue.</p>

<p>Until Bitcoin, there was no way to send money electronically between two parties without a third-party like a bank.  </p>

<p>Finally, in the United States, since 2009, 491 banks have failed.  Those failures cost taxpayers nearly $75B. Banking is much more fragile than we would like to believe.  E-commerce today ceases to exist without banks.  That is a considerable risk.</p>

<p><strong>E-Commerce is broken in almost every way.  Wampum will help drive the newer, safer, fraudless e-commerce of the future.</strong>
